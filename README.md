=================

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=293327176

Adds a compass to the Alien HUD in lieu of a minimap. An alternate mode points in the player's direction on the map rather than pointing North. 

To change modes, open the terminal and enter "compass <mode>". The available modes are: 

- 2 - Compass 
- 1 - Player orientation 
- 0 - Off 

Enhancements may come in the future.
